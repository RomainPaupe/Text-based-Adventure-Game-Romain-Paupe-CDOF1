# The Student Life Adventure Game 🎮

The **Student Life Adventure Game** is a text-based simulation where players navigate through the life of a student, making decisions that influence various aspects of their life, including academic performance, social interactions, and overall motivation. Over the course of five rounds, the player is faced with multiple choices such as studying for exams, hanging out with friends, relaxing, or procrastinating. Each decision impacts the student's grade, social life, and motivation, shaping the outcome of the game. By the end of the game, a summary is provided that evaluates the player's success in balancing school and personal life, offering insights into the consequences of their choices.
